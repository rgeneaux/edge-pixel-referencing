# Edge-pixel Referencing of Transient Absorption Data
This MATLAB code is a straighforward and efficient implementation of edge-pixel referencing of a transient absorption experiment using the correlation matrix method. It was initially developed for attosecond transient absorption and reflectivity experiments but should apply to various types of heterodyned spectroscopies.

The principle and performances of the method are described in R. Geneaux et al., "Source noise suppression in attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy by edge-pixel referencing" (to be published). This paper should be referenced if you end up using this code.
