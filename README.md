# Edge-pixel Referencing of Transient Absorption Data
This MATLAB code is a straighforward and efficient implementation of edge-pixel referencing of a transient absorption experiment using the correlation matrix method. It was initially developed for attosecond transient absorption and reflectivity experiments but should apply to various types of heterodyned spectroscopies.

The principle and performances of the method are described in R. GÃ©neaux, H.-T. Chang, A. M. Schwartzberg, and H. J. B. Marroux, *"Source noise suppression in attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy by edge-pixel referencing,"* Opt. Express **29**, 951-960 (2021). 

Thank you for referencing this paper if you end up using the code!
